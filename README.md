# FamilyFun

A simple networked multiplayer game.

Play game at: https://topherzee.github.io/familyfun/dist/

The goal is to have a collection of easy to learn mini-games that family can play while video chatting on ZOOM.

The first game is based on 'Werewolf/Mafia/Among Us'

- One player is the "Imposter", they try to kill as many other players without being detected.

- Use arrow keys to move.
- Use SPACEBAR to pickup and throw blocks.

- Imposter can use the 'k' key to kill. (Killed player shows state after 3 seconds.)
- Use the 'r' key to reset the game and choose a new Imposter.
- Use the 't' key to delete all players on firebase.

## Next steps

Imposter game:

- Tidy up code /scenes/game.js
- Add touchscreen support (iOS and android)
- Way to reset all players in Firebase (remove 'disconnected' players)
- Call a meeting. Win and lose of the imposter. Game ends.
- Dead players should be greyed out.

- Simpler domain name.
- Ability to create 'rooms'
- Intro screen to choose the game, create rooms, start games, choose the game, and explain what it is about.

- More games!
- Capture the flag
- Soccer
- Breakout
- Stackers
